### 1st Workshop for Green AI Application (GAIA Workshop)

The GAIA Workshop serves as the official final report session for the JST Young Researcher Exchange Program “NEXUS,” which ran from August through December 2025.

The program brought together students and faculty from Nara Institute of Science and Technology (NAIST), Singapore Management University (SMU), and Muhammadiyah Surakarta University (UMS).

At GAIA Workshop, NEXUS student teams will share their deliverables, followed by keynote talks from the supervising professors.

### 6th Workshop for Next-generation Software Ecosystems (ECO Workshop)

The ECO Workshop, hosted annually by the NAIST Software Engineering Lab., runs alongside GAIA to create a richer forum for diverse voices.

By co-locating both events, we aim to foster deeper exchanges of ideas across industry, academia, and student communities who are building resilient software ecosystems.
